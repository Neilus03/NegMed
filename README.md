# NegMed: Leveraging NLP Techniques for Negation and Uncertainty Detection in Medical Texts
 
Welcome to 'NegMed', on this project we will perform a Comparative Study of Rule-based and Deep Learning Approaches for negation, uncertainty and scope detection in medical documents
 
  
## Goals 

Our Objective is to implement two different methods with which we are able to achieve the detection of Uncertainties, Negations and scopes.


## Content

This repository contains the code and report for the NLP project on Negation, Uncertainty and Scopes detection, using a Rule Based and a Deep Learning approach.

### Data

You can get all the data you will need in the following folder from google drive so you don't need to search for it (ASHO's data, rights reserved).

### Files

- **[NegMed_RuleBased.ipynb](https://github.com/Neilus03/NegMed/blob/main/NegMed_RuleBased.ipynb)**: This file contains:
  - **`Data Handling`**: Create the groundtruth used for the qualitative evaluation for the negations, uncertainties and its respectives scopes. We have also extracted the texts in order to evaluate out method
  - **`Rule Based Algorithm`**: Series of functions in order to detect and extract the negations, uncertainties and its scopes and return the respectives in the same format as the grountruth to then evaluate.
  - **`Evaluation`**: Quantitative results of the rule-based method, `precision`, `recall` and `f-score`.
  
- **[NegMed_NER.ipynb](https://github.com/Neilus03/NegMed/blob/main/NegMed_NER.ipynb)**:  This file contains:
  - **`Data Handling`**: We splitted the data in train and validation sets and put it in a serialized format (.spacy) that can be used for training the model from `SpaCy` library.
  - **`Deep Learning Based Algorithm`**: A DL based Named Entity Recognition (**NER**)model with our defined entities that are: `NEG`, `NSCO`, `UNC` and `USCO` (negation, negation scope, uncertainty and uncertainty scope).
  - **`Evaluation`**: Both quantitaive and qualitative results of the deep learning model, `precision`, `recall` and `f-score` and examples of what returns our model when passing different texts (both medical and from other diverse topics such as legal or sports-related).

  **DOWNLOAD THE NOTEBOOK AND OPEN IT IN COLAB FOR A BETTER VISUALIZATION**

  **Note that the notebooks are already runned but if you want to run the NegMed_NER notebook from scratch you will need to download this folder and load the model that we fine-tuned, then you'll be able to run the code of the tests. Here you can access to the folder:** [**NER Model**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10N04PPava16SlouJeUsBN82W5jgI0Q8z?usp=sharing). You will need to upload the folder with all files inside in the notebook to load the model. We give you the link because is too heavy for uploading it in github.
  
  If you want to run the trainig of the model you will need to load the configuration file `config.cfg` that you have in this repository.

### Qualitative Evaluation
Below some qualitative examples that show the nice performance of our Deep Learning based **NER** model:

**1) Validation data from the original dataset:**

**2) Medical data outside the original dataset, never seen before by our model**

### Final Words

This project is an exciting journey into the intersection of medical texts and natural language processing. We hope that this project can serve as a helpful resource for those interested in Named Entity Recognition, deep learning, and AI in general.

We appreciate having had this experience that has helped us a lot to understand how complicated a real world NLP project can be, but also how exciting it is to get results after having done hard work.
